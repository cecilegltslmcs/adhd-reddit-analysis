# Analysis of Reddit posts

This project is a proof of a concept about Reddit posts analysis.
The aim of this project is :
- To find the main topic in the ADHD posts ;
- To perform a Named Entity Recognition to have an idea of the different treatment used in the ADHD.
- To do a sentiment analysis about the different posts.
After realizing this PoC, the next step is to collect new data to increase the amount of posts. It can be interesting to collect data from others sources or about others troubles such as Autism Spectrum Disorder or Dyslexia.
